float-view
==========
Float View(s) is becoming more and more popular in Chinese market, I hope this will help anyone having the same requirement.

A float view is added onto the screen from a Service. It can be dragged to anywhere, but when your finger leaves the screen, it will move to the left or right side automatically, based on the place of leaving point. When clicked, a layout will spread to the right/left and some buttons are available. The spread layout will fold automatically if no action is implemented for a period of time. And it will change to be grey if automatically in 2 seconds.

TODO:
1  All the animations are running in a linear way, it will be better if some vivid animations added.
2  Spread layout can only spread to right or left, find a way to make it spread to any angle.
3  Buttons in the spread layout is hard-coded, I will make it configurable later.
